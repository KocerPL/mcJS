# mcTS
Minecraft like game written in webgl with bad graphics
Creating chunks can take some time before rendering, please wait one minute if you wanna see anything
(Written for fun without optimizations or proper light algorithm)

To run this game you need to compile server and client,
which you can do using compileRun.sh script in this repo
or by manually going into Client and Server directories,
and typing npx tsc
when ready run the index file located in build/Server,
and it should give an address, on which game is run,
enter this address in browser, and you should see the
